## Development

### Setup

Install git hooks (requires [lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook)):

```bash
lefthook install
```

This configures a pre-commit hook that auto-formats code before each commit.

### Recipes

```bash
just -l              # List all available recipes
just build           # Build the library
just test            # Run tests
just fmt             # Check formatting
just fmt-fix         # Auto-format code
```
